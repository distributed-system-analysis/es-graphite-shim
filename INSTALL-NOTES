# SPECIAL NOTE:
# Stick to a PORT value and keep it constant throughout
# the installation steps. (make sure it doesn't collide with
# already running service on the same port.
# Take port based on the ones allowed under SELinux Policy
# to http. Check with following command:
# $ sudo semanage port -l | grep http

# Recommended: Take PORT as 9000 (it's pre-allotted to http).

# Install apache, mod_wsgi and configure it
yum install httpd python-devel mod_wsgi
# then add the following to httpd.conf:
# Listen PORT

# copy graphite_shim.conf to /etc/httpd/conf.d/ and add
cp graphite_shim.conf.example /etc/httpd/conf.d/ 
# and make sure the <VirtualHost *:PORT> is same as
# defined for 'Listen' direction under httpd.conf
# Also, check for following line in httpd.conf:
# IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf

# under es-graphite-shim/ copy shim_local.cfg as shim.cfg
# and fill necessary configurations

# copy the following folders to /opt/es-graphite-shim/
mkdir /opt/es-graphite-shim/
mkdir /opt/es-graphite-shim/logs /opt/es-graphite-shim/storage
cp -r es-graphite-shim/ /opt/es-graphite-shim/

# Add virtual env in under /opt/es-graphite-shim/
cd /opt/es-graphite-shim/
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
# (Optional) Deactivate venv
deactivate

#NOTE: example local config is given under:
# /opt/es-graphite-shim/conf/local_settings_example.py
# defaut: http://localhost:9200
cp /opt/es-graphite-shim/conf/local_settings_example.py \
   /opt/es-graphite-shim/es-graphite-shim/local_settings.py
# After this, add your elasticsearch instance and other configurations
# in /opt/es-graphite-shim/es-graphite-shim/local_settings.py
#  - DB field is optional and is not used currently.
#    provide the hostname as the host where the shim is to be installed.
#  - the FRESH field is for an internal functionality. Let it remain as
#    default value in example config.
#  - Don't forget to modify SECRET_KEY field as well.
#  - INDEX_PREFIX and DOC_TYPE are used to indicate the index name
#    pattern. Its recommended to name your ES indices in a manner so that
#    selecting them while querying becomes easier, so as to avoid
#    querying all indices. The pattern here is:
#    	      INDEX_PREFIX.DOC_TYPE-<unique index pattern here>
#  - Add the FIELD name as the first metric parameter in the graphite based
#    dot separated metric path.
#    Example, if we have a metric path as: log1.value1.sub1..
#    then the FIELD name would consider the field type of log1.
#    This is used to query and provide info about first metric in grafana
#    in dropdown list.

# create log files
touch /opt/es-graphite-shim/logs/error.log
touch /opt/es-graphite-shim/logs/access.log

# Optional: create django db and make sure you keep
# the same password under DATABASE config in:
# /opt/es-graphite-shim/es-graphite-shim/local_settings.py
python /opt/es-graphite-shim/es-graphite-shim/manage.py syncdb

# Go to /opt/es-graphite-shim/es-graphite-shim/es-graphite-shim/settings.py
# set SECRET_KEY to a big random key
# set ALLOWED_HOSTS to [ 'localhost', '<any other hostnames']
# by default, it's set to '*'
# set TIME_ZONE to you local time.

# change ownership/SELinux policies of /opt/es-graphite-shim/
chown -R apache:apache /opt/es-graphite-shim/
semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t  '/opt/es-graphite-shim(/.*)?'
restorecon -v -R /opt/es-graphite-shim/
restorecon -v -R /opt/es-graphite-shim/*

# add ES to http port, so connections from 9200
# aren't blocked by SELinux for httpd
semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 9200

# FIX ME: since SELinux blocks communications to port 9200 with httpd
# disable selinux temporarily (will add a more decent step later)
setenforce 0

# restart the httpd server
service httpd restart

# in case you face errors, check the apache OR es-graphite-shim log files.
# ultimately, don't forget to switch the 'graphite' URL
# under config.json in the source of Grafana.
